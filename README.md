# ☕ JavaConsoleGames
This is a repository that stores various console games that are somehow related to mathematics. You can safely use it as a source of ideas and inspiration.

# 🧩 Current games:
Right now, this repository consists of:

1. LightsOut - "Lights Out" puzzle game with a solver (an algorithm based on linear algebra).
2. TowerOfHanoi - fully customizable "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle game [TODO: implement solver]

# 🚀 Getting started:
1. Clone this repository
 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AnotherUser269/JavaConsoleGames/
```

2. To get more information about the compiling procedure, go to the specified project folder and read its README file.

# ✅ Requirements:
1. Java 17+
2. Console / terminal

# ℹ️ Important:
1) For proper display, it is recommended to use a monospaced font (e.g. Courier New) in the console configuration. If the text appears distorted or misaligned, try adjusting the font size.

2) If after changing the font, random symbols appear instead of text, try changing the configuration file settings.

3) If the console does not clear properly, change "RIS" (full clear) in the configuration file to "PRINTLN" (one empty line between screens) or "CURSOR_HOME_CLEAR" (clear with cursor return to the start).
